Time Wars,Mark,Fisher,20,p,Time rather than money is the currency in the recent science fiction film In Time.,1"At the age of 25, the citizens in the future world the film depicts are given only a year more to live.",0"To survive any longer, they must earn extra time.

",6Yet even those within relatively stable forms of employment are not immune from precarity.,0"Many workers now have to periodically revalidate their status via systems of ""continuous professional development""; almost all work, no matter how menial, involves self-surveillance systems in which the worker is required to assess their own performance.

Corporations break up or join together, jobs appear and disappear, as events lacking connection."" (30)",0"Throughout history, humans have learned to come to terms with the traumatic upheavals caused by war or natural disasters, but ""[w]hat's peculiar about uncertainty today,"" Sennett points out, ""is that it exists without any looming historical disaster; instead it is woven into the everyday practices of a vigorous capitalism.""",0p,It isn't only work that has become more tenuous.,1"The neoliberal attacks on public services, welfare programmes and trade unions mean that we are increasingly living in a world deprived of security or solidarity.",3The consequence of the normalisation of uncertainty is a permanent state of low-level panic.,2"Fear, which attaches to particular objects, is replaced by a more generalised anxiety, a constant twitching, an inability to settle.",0The uncertainty of work is intensified by digital communication technology.,1"As soon as there is email, there are no longer working hours nor a workplace.",2"What characterises the present moment more than our anxious checking - of our messages, which may bring opportunities or demands (often both at the same time), or, more abstractly, of our status, which, like the stock market is constantly under review, never finally resolved?",0p,"We are very far from the ""society of leisure"" that was confidently predicted in the 1970s.",1"Contrary to the hopes raised at that time, technology has not liberated us from work.",2"As Federico Campagna writes in his article ""Radical Atheism"", published on the Through Europe website.",0"""In the current age of machines ... humans finally have the possibility of devolving most productive processes to technological apparatus, while retaining all outcomes for themselves.

The necessary time for paying attention to the fluxes of information is lacking.""",1p,"The consequence is a strange kind of existential state, in which exhaustion bleeds into insomniac overstimulation (no matter how tired we are, there is still time for one more click) and enjoyment and anxiety co-exist (the urge to check emails, for instance, is both something we must do for work and a libidinal compulsion, a psychoanalytic drive that is never satisfied no matter how many messages we receive).",9"The fact that the smart phone makes cyberspace available practically anywhere at anytime means that boredom (or at least the old style, 'Fordist' boredom) has effectively been eliminated from social life.",1"Yet boredom, like death, posed existential challenges that are far more easily deferred in the always-on cyberspatial environment.",0"Ultimately, communicative capitalism does not vanquish boredom so much as it ""sublates"" it, seeming to destroy it only to preserve it in a new synthesis.",1"The characteristic affective tonality for the insomniac drift of cyberspace, in which there is always one more click to make, one more update to check, combines fascination with boredom.
